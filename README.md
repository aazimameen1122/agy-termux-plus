# Antigravity CLI for Termux — Plus Edition

Run Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`) natively on Android inside Termux — with no glibc chroot, no proot, and no VM.

This is a feature fork of [Aarstad/agy-termux-musl](https://github.com/Aarstad/agy-termux-musl): everything upstream does (musl loader, surgical binary patches, proxy, updater control), plus phone-native tooling — a health checker, a session runner with wake-lock and notifications, a managed proxy daemon, resilient downloads, release notes, and home-screen shortcuts. See [What's new in this fork](#whats-new-in-this-fork).

This installer sets up the ARM64 binary to run against a lightweight musl loader (~720KB instead of a ~450MB glibc environment), applies surgical binary patches for Android execution, and provides a small background proxy so networking and DNS work seamlessly.

Unlike heavier agent CLIs (which often hold 1.0–1.5 GB resident RAM across subagents and daemon hosts), `agy` sips a lean **~80 MB of RAM** while running live model turns natively in Termux.

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements

- **Termux on ARM64 (`aarch64`)**: Run `uname -m` to verify it prints `aarch64`.
- **No external loader package required**: the musl loader is vendored directly in `lib/` (see [The Vendored musl Loader](#the-vendored-musl-loader)).
- **Build tools & dependencies**: `curl`, `tar`, `clang`, `python3`, `patchelf`.
- **A Google account** with Antigravity access.

### 2. Install

Open **Termux** and run:

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites
pkg update
pkg install git curl tar clang python patchelf

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aarstad/agy-termux-musl.git
cd agy-termux-musl

# 3. Fetch, patch, and install
./install.sh

# 4. (Optional) Add agy to your PATH
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf "$PWD/agy" ~/.local/bin/agy
```

The only network fetch is Google's own release tarball. `./install.sh --from-binary <path>` patches a binary you already have instead.

If `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`, you can now run `agy` from anywhere.

### 3. Sign in and Verify

Run:

```bash
agy models
```

Follow the browser prompt to sign in with your Google account. Once authenticated, `agy` will list available models (e.g. Gemini 3.8 Flash, Gemini 3.1 Pro) and is ready for interactive coding sessions.

```bash
# Start an interactive session in your project
agy
```

### 4. Keeping it up to date

`agy`'s built-in auto-updater is off (see [Troubleshooting](#cannot-execute-required-file-not-found-on-launch)), so updates happen when you ask for them:

```bash
./agy-update --check      # compare installed against the latest release
./agy-update              # fetch it, patch it, verify it, install it
./agy-update --rollback   # go back to the previous binary
```

It resolves the newest release from GitHub, hands the binary to `install.sh` to patch and verify, and only replaces `agy.bin` once the patched build has been proven to run. The previous binary is kept as `agy.bin.prev` (a hard link, so it costs nothing until one of them changes); `--no-backup` skips it.

`./agy-update --changelog` prints the latest release notes without updating; a normal update shows the notes for the new version before downloading.

`./install.sh` on its own installs a **pinned** version, not the latest — use `agy-update` unless you want a specific build.

### What's new in this fork

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./agy-doctor` | Health check: arch, toolchain, musl loader, shim, patch state (via `patch.py --dry-run`), proxy, DNS, TLS bundle, termux-api, `git`/`curl` HTTPS sanity, disk, login state. `--quick` skips the slow network checks. |
| `./agy-run` | Phone-native session runner. Holds a Termux wake-lock during the run, saves the transcript to `~/.local/share/agy-plus/sessions/`, and on finish can notify (`--notify`), copy the transcript to the clipboard (`--copy`), read a summary aloud (`--speak`), or push it to Telegram (`--tg`). |
| `./agy-proxyctl` | Manages the shared proxy daemon (`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`log`) on `127.0.0.1:18080` so one proxy serves agy and every other musl tool. The `agy` wrapper picks it up automatically. |
| `./setup-widget.sh` | Generates home-screen shortcuts in `~/.shortcuts` for Termux:Widget (models, update, doctor, proxy). |
| Resilient downloads | `install.sh` and `agy-update` try `curl`, then `wget`, then `python3` — one broken tool no longer blocks installs or updates. |
| Official musl builds | `./install.sh --official-musl` uses Google's own musl release (static binary — no loader, no shim). `agy-update` stays on whichever track you installed. |

### Google's official musl build

Recent agy releases (1.2.16+) ship `agy_cli_linux_arm64_musl.tar.gz` — a **fully static** musl binary. Verified: `patch.py` applies the same 56 bytes (all 14 sites, byte-identical) to it, so the three Android bugs are fixed the same way; the loader/shim steps are skipped automatically for static binaries, and the `agy` wrapper's self-repair plus `agy-doctor` both understand static installs.

```bash
./install.sh --official-musl        # latest release, official musl build
./install.sh --official-musl --version 1.2.16
```

`agy-update` matches the installed binary's track on its own (static stays musl, dynamic stays glibc+patch); `--official-musl` / `--glibc` force a track.

Example — start a long task, lock the phone, get pinged when it is done:

```bash
./agy-run --notify --tg --name refactor -- -p "refactor the auth module"
```

`--tg` needs `~/.config/agy-plus/telegram.env` with `AGY_TG_BOT_TOKEN` (from @BotFather) and `AGY_TG_CHAT_ID`.

### 5. (Optional) Phone integrations

- **Termux:API** (`pkg install termux-api` + the Termux:API app): unlocks `--notify`, `--copy`, `--speak` in `agy-run`.
- **Termux:Widget** (the app): `./setup-widget.sh`, then add the widget to your home screen.

## The Vendored musl Loader

There is nothing to install. `lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` is musl 1.2.6, taken unmodified from Alpine Linux's `musl` package and checked into this repo (MIT licensed, `lib/musl-COPYRIGHT`). `install.sh` points `agy.bin`'s `PT_INTERP` at that file, so `agy` runs from the checkout without touching `$PREFIX/lib`. Moving the checkout means re-running `./install.sh --from-binary agy.bin`.

---

## What Works

- **Interactive CLI & Full Turn Sessions**: Streaming output, multi-turn reasoning, and local SQLite state persistence.
- **Built-in Tool Execution**: File reading/writing, workspace search, terminal bash command execution.
- **Model Selection & Switching**: Seamlessly switch between Gemini 3.8 Flash, Gemini 3.1 Pro, etc.
- **Subagents**: Autonomous subagent spawning, task delegation, and lifecycle management.
- **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers (e.g. external servers running under `bun` or `node`) called via tool use.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### `cannot execute: required file not found` on launch
`agy` spawns a background auto-updater about a second into **every** session. When an update lands, it renames `agy.bin` to `agy.bin.<nanos>.old` and writes a stock Google build in its place, undoing every patch applied here. The stock build asks for glibc's loader, which Android does not have — so the *next* launch fails with this message, often hours later and with nothing on screen connecting the two.

The session that triggered the update keeps working, because the running process still holds the renamed inode (`/proc/<pid>/exe -> ...old`). Only the next start breaks.

Two things in the `agy` wrapper deal with this:
- **The updater is off by default.** The wrapper exports `AGY_CLI_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true`, which `agy` checks before spawning it (`auto_updater.go:247`). The value must be exactly `true` — the binary compares four bytes and ignores anything else, `1` included, without a word about it. The variable appears in no help output. Update deliberately with [`./agy-update`](#4-keeping-it-up-to-date), or allow the built-in updater for a single run with `AGY_ALLOW_UPDATE=1`.
- **If a stock build lands anyway**, the wrapper reads `PT_INTERP` before exec and re-runs `install.sh --from-binary` to put the patches back. Set `AGY_NO_REPAIR=1` to be told about it instead of repaired.

The updater also deletes its own `.old` backups, so don't count on one being there. Keep a copy of a known-good binary if you want a fast way back.

### TCMalloc abort / "Memory mapping failed" on startup
Historically, Google's bundled TCMalloc allocator was assumed to break on Android's 39-bit virtual address space (`VA39`) because of 48-bit address tags. Upstream issues (#9, #64) and early 1.0.x community builds relied on wallentx's `agy.va39` engine, which binary-patched 40 TCMalloc address-shift instructions.

- **Status in v1.2.7+ / v1.2.8**: **Stock Google binaries do not trigger the TCMalloc abort.** Tracing stock 1.2.8 with `strace` across startup and active multi-turn sessions shows **0 calls to TCMalloc's system allocator** (`MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE` 1 GB reservations). Active heap allocations are handled by Go's runtime allocator (whose 64MB arena hints the Linux kernel safely relocates).
- **Stress-tested under real memory pressure**: Tested extensively on a confirmed VA39 device (Android 16 aarch64) under continuous low-memory conditions with 1.5–2.4 GB of active system swap. Stock unpatched TCMalloc completed all sessions without a single abort or mapping error.
- **Installation**: Stock binaries work directly via `patch.py`. `install.sh` still runs the patched binary before installing it, so a future release that reintroduces the abort is refused rather than installed.

### Network hangs or TLS certificate errors
Android lacks standard Linux paths like `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.
- The included `agy` wrapper automatically points to the shared proxy daemon (`termux-http-proxy`) on `127.0.0.1:18080` if running, or launches an ephemeral companion proxy (`termux-http-proxy`) as fallback.
- Sets `SSL_CERT_FILE="$PREFIX/etc/tls/cert.pem"` for trusted root CA verification.
- If you run the raw binary directly (`./agy.bin`), DNS queries will hang. Always launch via `./agy` (or the symlink).

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

For the curious: Google distributes `agy` as a glibc-linked dynamic PIE executable. Making it run on Android under musl required solving five distinct hurdles:

1. **glibc to musl Loader & Shim (`shim.c`)**:
   The ELF interpreter is repointed to the vendored `lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`. A tiny 40-line C shim (`lib/libagyshim.so`) provides missing glibc symbols (`__open`, `__close`, `__read`, `pvalloc`, pthread cancellation stubs).
2. **Dynamic Phdr Load-Bias Heuristic (`patch.py`)**:
   The internal binary function `google_find_phdr` miscalculated load biases under non-prelinking loaders due to an unsigned 64-bit comparison against `0xfffffffefffff001`. Replacing 5 conditional selects (`csel`) with unconditional moves (`mov`) fixes the crash at startup (20 bytes patched).
3. **Thread-Control-Block (TCB) Fallback (`patch.py`)**:
   Glibc reserves several hundred bytes below the thread pointer (`[tp - 0x260]`). Musl has a smaller TCB, causing segfaults on unmapped memory. Forcing the check to zero routes execution into Google's built-in global fallback path (4 bytes patched).
4. **seccomp-blocked `faccessat2` (`patch.py`)**:
   Go's `os/exec.LookPath` calls `unix.Eaccess` on any candidate that exists, which issues syscall 439. Android's seccomp filter answers an unknown syscall number with `SIGSYS` rather than `ENOSYS`, so Go never reaches its permission-bit fallback — the CLI dies in `clipboard` package init, before `main()`, from the moment `termux-clipboard-get` is on `$PATH`. The number in the `syscall.faccessat2` wrapper is rewritten to 48, plain `faccessat`, which the filter allows (4 bytes patched).
5. **Android DNS & TLS Integration (`termux-http-proxy.c`)**:
   A lightweight, single-threaded `epoll` + `splice(2)` proxy bridges network lookups to Android's bionic resolver, while Termux's certificate bundle provides trusted root CAs. Can run as a shared background service across all musl tools. Developed in [termux-http-proxy](https://github.com/Aarstad/termux-http-proxy).
